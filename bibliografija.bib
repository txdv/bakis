%talking about fast compilers
%slow compilers are ok if the output is faster for big projects like chrome
%compilers need to be fast in order to provide performance analysis faster because when a programmer gets immediate feedback that his code got slower, he is more likely to change it

%biggest performance increase is when compilation go down from 2 minutes to 1second
from 1s to 100ms

  abstract = {This paper is a tutorial on defining recursive descent parsers in Haskell. In the spirit of one-stop shopping, the paper combines material from three areas into a single source. The three areas are functional parsers (Burge, 1975; Wadler, 1985; Hutton, 1992; Fokker, 1995), the use of monads to structure functional programs (Wadler, 1990, 1992a, 1992b), and the use of special syntax for monadic programs in Haskell (Jones, 1995; Peterson et al., 1996). More specifically, the paper shows how to define monadic parsers using do notation in Haskell.Of course, recursive descent parsers defined by hand lack the efficiency of bottom-up parsers generated by machine (Aho et al., 1986; Mogensen, 1993; Gill and Marlow, 1995). However, for many research applications, a simple recursive descent parser is perfectly sufficient. Moreover, while parser generators typically offer a fixed set of combinators for describing grammars, the method described here is completely extensible: parsers are first-class values, and we have the full power of Haskell available to define new combinators for special applications. The method is also an excellent illustration of the elegance of functional programming.},

  abstract = {Scala is an object-oriented programming language for the Java VirtualMachine. In addition to being object-oriented, Scala is also afunctional language, and combines the best approaches to OO andfunctional programming.In Italian, Scala means a stairway, or steps. Indeed, Scala lets you step up to a programming environment that incorporates some of the best recent thinking in programming language design while also letting youuse all your existing Java code.Artima is very pleased to publish a new edition of the best-sellingbook on Scala, written by the designer of the language, Martin Odersky.Co-authored by Lex Spoon and Bill Venners, this book takes astep-by-step tutorial approach to teaching you Scala. Starting with thefundamental elements of the language, Programming in Scala introducesfunctional programming from the practitioner's perspective, anddescribes advanced language features that can make you a better, moreproductive developer.}
